    <h3>Background</h3><br />
    <div class="exp-txt">
        Path Planner calculates the shortest path using the <span title="The solution to the traveling salesman problem is carried out using the genetic algorithm. What is the genetic algorithm? This algorithm behaves in the same way that human genes behave in evolution. The intention is that this algorithm produces a generation of possible solutions, pairs them, and thus they supposedly give birth, creating a new generation. In fact, this is how the algorithm continues for several 'generations' , until it reaches an answer that satisfies it (the most efficient solution). The genetic algorithm is mainly used to solve optimization problems for which a deterministic or probabilistic solution that works in reasonable time is not known. In our output appears the word 'Generation' , this word describes the number of generations until reaching the possible¬†solution.">genetic algorithm</span>.
        The system produces generations of trajectories just like generations in our evolution.
        In each generation there are mutations in the DNA of the entities and there is an evolution of the entity so
        that it is more suitable to the required conditions, in our case: the lowest number of kilometers.
